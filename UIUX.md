Here are some of the UI/UX improvement attempts you've made:
1. **Positioning Icons and Buttons**:
   - I adjusted the position of navigation icons (like `KeyboardArrowUpIcon` and `KeyboardArrowDownIcon`) to ensure they are properly aligned within the slide, become visible only when necessary, and are positioned to prevent overlap with content.
   - I also added a `DeleteIcon` and positioned it to the right of `AddCircleIcon`, ensuring the spacing between them remains consistent regardless of screen size. This helps maintain a clean, accessible design.

2. **Dynamic Icon Visibility and States**:
   - I worked to make the navigation icons (`KeyboardArrowUpIcon` and `KeyboardArrowDownIcon`) appear or disappear based on the slide position (first or last slide) and disabled them when necessary. This helps users understand navigation limitations and avoids confusion.
   - Additionally, I implemented dynamic cursor states for these icons to visually indicate when theyâ€™re clickable or not.

3. **Error Handling for Slide Deletion**:
   - When a user attempts to delete the only slide, I added an error message popup instead of allowing deletion. This prevents accidental data loss and informs users about the limitations on slide deletion, making the experience more user-friendly.

4. **Slide Count Display**:
   - I made efforts to display the slide count dynamically, using `Object.keys(presentation).length - 1` to calculate the number of slides. This keeps users informed about their progress and helps them understand the structure of their presentation.

5. **Keyboard Navigation Support**:
   - By adding left and right arrow key support for navigation, I provided users with a more accessible way to switch between slides, improving the overall usability of the slideshow interface.

6. **Error and Confirmation Modals**:
   - I used modals for confirmation before deleting the presentation and displaying errors. These modals help guide users through important actions, preventing mistakes and offering clear feedback.

7. **Aspect Ratio Consistency**:
   - I set a fixed aspect ratio of 16:9 for the slide display area, ensuring a consistent viewing experience across different screen sizes. This creates a visually appealing and stable layout.

8. **Icon and Button Sizing and Colors**:
   - I applied consistent styling for icon and button colors, sizes, and hover effects to make them visually distinct and intuitive to use. This includes using grey colors to indicate inactive states, providing subtle guidance on interactability.

These improvements collectively enhance the UI/UX by ensuring that the interface is visually consistent, accessible, and responsive to user actions, ultimately creating a more seamless experience.
